Reflective Answers for Q1

Breakdown of Argument and Option Handling:
 The script uses a while loop to parse arguments, handling options (-n, -v, -vn, -nv, --help) 
 via a case statement. Non-option arguments are assigned to pattern and filename, with 
 validation for missing arguments and file readability.

Supporting Regex or -i/-c/-l Options:
 For regex, I’d modify grep -qi to grep -E. For -i, the script already uses
  grep -qi. For -c, I’d add a counter for matching lines. For -l, I’d print the
   filename if a match is found.
   

Hardest Part:
 Handling the -vn and -nv combinations was challenging, but I 
 addressed it by explicitly checking both cases in the case statement.
